## Create it
With ZenDivider extension, there are many ways to create a Divider.
- 📌 **Toolbar Button**: Click on the extension to create a new Divider. You can pin the extension to the browser toolbar for easier access.
- 🖱️ **Context Menu**: Right click on any tab and select `New Divider`, a new Divider will be created in front of that tab.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcut**: Set your own keyboard shortcut to create a new Divider. The extension does not provide a pre-set shortcut, so you must first set your own. See [Manage extension shortcuts in Firefox](https://mzl.la/3Qwp5QQ) to learn how.
- 🌐 **Omnibar**:
  - Type `zd` into the address bar, follow it with a space, then press `Enter` to create a new Divider.
  - Type `zd` into the address bar, add a space, and type in the name of that Divider, then press `Enter` to create a new pre-filled Divider.
  - Zen Browser currently has a bug that breaks Omnibar shortcuts provided by extensions, so Omnibar functionality currently does not work in Zen Browser. But it still works in Firefox during my test.
 
## Rename it
A Divider in ZenDivider is a simple tab with a large textbox in the middle. Whatever you typed inside it, they'll appear on the Divider's tab title. Then, you can move it around to help divide & organize your tabs into sections, which is really ideal for when you have tons of tabs (and looks really good with vertical tabs) (it also changes between dark & light theme according to your browser settings)
- ✏️ Go ahead, give it a name. They're automatically saved as you type, but if you want to unfocus the textbox, just press `Enter` or `Esc` (and click on the textbox again if you want to type some more).  
- 💾 If your browser is set to restore tabs from previous session, all those Dividers will also be remembered & persist between sessions alongside your tabs.  

## Move it
↕️ Move your Dividers around and use it to divide & organize your tabs. Move it like you do with normal tabs.

## Note
ZenDivider Extension is required in order to view Dividers opened via ZenDivider Extension.
   - ☁️🔄️💻🖥️📱 Please consider this fact when syncing tabs between multiple devices. ZenDivider tabs will be invalid when opened on a device without ZenDivider Extension installed.
   - 🗑️ Dividers opened via ZenDivider Extension will be lost when the extension is removed. Please organize your tabs before removing the extension.

## Curiosity Corner
- ⚡ This extension is completely local & offline. It does not connect to the internet.
- 🍃 This extension does not use any frameworks; it's just a plain and simple HTML & JS.
- 📄 ZenDivider was originally a single-page application: a single HTML file that you can open in a browser. You can use it without getting this extension. ~~Learn more [here](https://github.com/BarnMTB/ZenDivider).~~ Currently working on the repository.
  - ZenDivider Extension stores a version of ZenDivider inside itself and integrates with the browser to provide a quicker, easier way to access & open ZenDivider.  
  - In other words: the original, standalone ZenDivider file is like getting a bottle of soda: some will have a harder time popping that bottle. ZenDivider Extension is like getting that same bottle of soda along with a nice, easy to use bottle opener. Some will prefer not having to carry that bottle opener around, and some will prefer the convenience of having a bottle opener.
  - Note that you can't automatically migrate Dividers opened via ZenDivider Extension to a Divider opened from a standalone ZenDivider HTML file. Migration between the two have to be done manually.

---
ZenDivider Extension, ZenDivider, including its developer, is not associated or affiliated with Zen Browser or its developers in any way, shape, or form. I created ZenDivider because my tabs are piling up and I realize I can do something about it that doesn't involve tinkering around the browser files & risk having something broken sooner or later in an update (and then spend more time diagnosing when it does break) or enabling WIP features & risk tab loss.
